# My Sandwich Api :sandwich:

This is my own mock version of an API. It does not have any routing or controllers. The API is a stripped down light version of an API thanks to this [json server pacakge](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) and [inspired by](https://github.com/kubowania/burger-api).
